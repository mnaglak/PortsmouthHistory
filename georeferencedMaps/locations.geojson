The three-story brick structures built in the 19th century were demolished during the urban renewal of the 1960s. In 1975, Indian Head Bank built an unsightly drive-through teller, which lasted a scant 13 years before the advent of the ATM made it redundant, and the building was again demolished. It remained a parking lot until the new Brick Market was completed in early 2023. While this strikingly contemporary building has garnered its fair share of praise and derision, its architecture makes a better effort to complement the historic surrounding structures than its drive-through predecessor.\r\nwww.brick-market.com \r\n","Credit":"McNabb Properties","ImageURL":null}}]
